I’ve needed to add to my portfolio while on my job hunt, so for the past week I’ve been working on analysis of the disparity of mice used in Fortnite. 
Intuitively I knew that FinalMouse was a much more popular brand within the Fortnite scene compared to other games, but I wanted to determine by how much and why. 
Refer to the picture to see that over 81% of professional gamers who use a FinalMouse are Fortnite pros, while only 8% of all mice used across four FPS games are FinalMouse mice. 
I can present my full analysis and data collection if wanted, but from what I’ve found, the conclusion can be lead to the appeal to authority/popularity fallacy along with exceptional marketing by FM; essentially, FinalMouse initially broke into the scene by creating the first ever esports professional branded mouse (FM Scream 1) and carried that momentum into a unique product (FM Ultralight – unique design with honeycomb holes drilled into the mouse to reduce weight), from there they released a newer version of the Ultralight in partnership with Ninja at the peak of his popularity. 
A culmination of everything mentioned, while being one the first company to revolutionize mice for fast paced FPS games lead to them being the most popular brand with new competitive FPS players (I suppose older gamers are already accustomed to a certain mouse/brand/shape/weight).
